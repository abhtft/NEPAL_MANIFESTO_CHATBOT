After achieving this and restoring parliament the Country can move ahead based on the points 
mentioned in the manifesto as the road map. 
The goal of this manifesto is therefore twofold: to show that transformation is achievable, and to 
provide a foundation for building a system that is just, accountable, and rooted in the aspirations 
of the Nepali people. 
If you believe in this movement, don’t just skim this document - speak it, share it, test it and add 
on to it. Critique what doesn’t work. Improve what does. But most of all, don’t stop at protest. 
Let this become our working blueprint for action and accountability.  
 
A revolution is not measured by how many streets it fills or how much tear gas it survives. A 
revolution is measured by whether it builds a state that governs fairly, transparently and for the 
people, not one that exploits them.  
 
This is the standard to which we hold ourselves, our institutions, and our leaders!

protection, and grievance mechanisms. 
• Implement Contribution-Based Social Security for the Informal Economy: Prioritize 
effective rollout of the contribution -based social security program to cover informal 
sector workers, addressing the “missing middle” gap in Nepal’s social protection system. 
Performance Targets: 
• Fully implement the Integrated National Framework on Social Protection to harmonize 
fragmented laws and entitlements. 
• Raise overall population coverage to 50% by 2027 and move towards the national goal of 
60% by 2030. 
• Universalize the Child Grant nationwide, reaching all children under five, and 
progressively extend to all children by 2030. 
• Extend contributory health/social insurance to at least X% of informal workers by 2030, 
using subsidies for low-income groups. 
• Increase cash transfer levels (e.g., Child Grant) to cover at least 15% of the Minimum 
Expenditure Basket by 2028.

The Problem: Nepal is losing high-value investors due to fragmented rules, bureaucratic rigidity, 
restrictive sectoral limitations, and weak profitability incentives. The recent destruction of 
infrastructure and businesses, both local and foreign, has set back economic  development by 
decades, leaving many enterprises unable to resume operations. This further discourages foreign 
investment, which has already been in decline, and risks higher unemployment and out -
migration. 
Policies like FITTA impose ownership restrictions in key sectors (aviation, telecommunications, 
insurance) and maintain negative lists that block investment entirely in some areas. These 
constraints, combined with rigid, inconsistent, and micromanaged trea tment by government 
officials, undermine investor confidence. Regulatory bodies such as the Office of Company 
Registrar and the Department of Industries often lack the expertise or capacity to support and 
facilitate business effectively.",7|5|177|105,economy|growth|jobs|investment,0.0,True,True,True,True,True,True,0.9999999999999999
