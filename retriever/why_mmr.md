Let’s analyze whether MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) is giving proper results in your case, based on the answer and the supporting source documents provided.

1. Is there high diversity in the answer?
Yes:
The answer covers a broad range of actions for Nepali citizens:

Legal reforms (electoral law, expense reports)
Decentralization of power
Strengthening anti-corruption institutions (CIAA, courts, prosecutors)
Demanding transparency (wealth disclosure, qualifications)
Civic participation (elections, civil society)
Protecting democratic institutions
Whistleblowing & witness protection
This shows diversity—the answer isn’t just repeating the same point, but includes many non-overlapping ideas.

2. Are the source documents diverse and relevant?
Source documents reference:

Electoral reforms and financial transparency
Power decentralization and budget allocation
Constitutional process during crisis
Anti-corruption institution reforms, technological tools, and witness protection
The content of the source documents is not redundant; each brings a unique aspect of the recommendations.

3. Is there evidence of reduced duplication/near-duplication?
There is no noticeable duplication in the answer or in the content extracted from the source documents. Each point is distinct and supported by a different part of the source material.

4. Is the information relevant?
Yes. All retrieved documents are directly relevant to the question—how Nepali citizens can act to secure freedom and prevent corruption.

Conclusion
MMR is working well in this case.

The retrieved documents are relevant to the query.
They are not duplicates or near-duplicates; each adds unique value.
The final answer combines diverse, non-repetitive recommendations.
Why is this happening?
Because:

fetch_k=20 provides a good candidate pool for diversity.
k=4 ensures only the top, most diverse results are chosen.
lambda_mult=0.5 balances relevance and diversity.
If MMR was not working:
You would see similar or overlapping content in the answer and source docs.
There would be repetition of ideas (e.g., several points about only electoral reform).
Summary:
In this example, MMR is giving proper results: relevant, varied, and non-duplicative content. If you consistently see this pattern, your MMR settings are well-tuned!
